# 🎵 Music Classification with FMA

This project focuses on classifying music tracks using the FMA (Free Music Archive) dataset. Developed using Python and a variety of machine learning and deep learning libraries, the project is implemented in a Jupyter notebook. It is inspired by the work: "FMA: A Dataset For Music Analysis" by Michaël Defferrard, Kirell Benzi, Pierre Vandergheynst, and Xavier Bresson (EPFL LTS2). 🎼
